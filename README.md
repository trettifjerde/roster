# Roster Calculator

A utility developed for [SolidGames](https://sg.zone).

Designed to help SolidGames Sides Manager assign player squads to competing sides on different game servers.

- Ensures squads are distributed evenly
- Takes into account preferences the squads expressed on what squads they would and would not like to play with
- Provides detailed information on each squad's happiness level in every suggested roster

A user can easily edit squads information right inside the app, as well as upload their own squads info from JSON file. The in-app squads information can also be exported for future use.

**Warning**! If the total number of squads excedes 25, it is highly not recommended to use the app on mobile devices since such roster calculations require significant computing resources and a couple of GB of RAM to store intermediate results. 

The deployed app can be found here: https://roster-phi.vercel.app/
